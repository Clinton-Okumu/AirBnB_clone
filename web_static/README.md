    How to create an HTML page?
    To create an HTML page, you need to write HTML code using a text editor. An HTML page typically starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by <html> and <head> sections where you can specify metadata like the page title and include external resources like CSS and JavaScript. The main content of the page is placed within the <body> section.

    What is a markup language?
    A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. HTML is an example of a markup language where elements are used to define the structure of a document.

    What is the DOM?
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of HTML and XML documents as a tree-like structure where each node represents a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text). The DOM provides a way for programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web documents.

    What is an element/tag?
    In HTML, an element (or tag) is a fundamental building block that defines different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc. Elements are surrounded by angle brackets, and they typically have an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

    What is an attribute?
    An attribute provides additional information about an HTML element and is specified within the opening tag of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

    How does the browser load a webpage?
    When you enter a URL into a browser, it sends a request to the server hosting the webpage. The server then responds with the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources needed to render the page. The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM, requests additional resources like CSS and JavaScript files, and then renders the page based on the DOM and CSSOM (CSS Object Model).

    What is CSS?
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS defines how elements are displayed on the screen, such as their layout, colors, fonts, and sizes.

    How to add style to an element?
    You can add styles to an HTML element by using CSS. You can apply styles directly to individual elements using inline styles, or you can define styles in a separate CSS file and apply them using selectors.

    What is a class?
    A class is a way to apply a specific set of styles to one or more HTML elements. Classes are defined in CSS and can be applied to elements using the class attribute.

    What is a selector?
    A selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. Selectors can target elements based on their tag name, class, ID, attributes, or their relationship with other elements.

    How to compute CSS Specificity Value?
    CSS specificity is a weight that determines which CSS rule takes precedence when multiple rules apply to the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the combination of selectors used in the CSS rule. Generally, the more specific the selector, the higher its specificity value.

    What are Box properties in CSS?
    Box properties in CSS refer to properties that define the dimensions and layout of an element's box model. This includes properties like width, height, padding, margin, border, and position. These properties control how the element is rendered within the document layout.
